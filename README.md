## 🚧 About This Project

**Project Digital Kizuna** is my open-source Unity project that aims to create a **personal chatbot with a 3D character model** (highly inspired by Desktop Mate). Users can interact with the chatbot as a virtual partner, assistant, or companion.

## 📅 Features

This project is designed to allow user to import your own 3d model that you like, as the appearance of the chatbot, and have conversation with the chatbot via voice by integrating voice model (If possible i may also implement pc system interaction features, like opening apps)
